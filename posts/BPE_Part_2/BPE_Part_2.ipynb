    "In my last post, I discussed encoding text, specifically using UTF-8. As I noted there, this encoding uses 1 to 4 bytes to represent all the characters in the Unicode system. This will be the *byte* part of *byte pair encoding (BPE)*, which was introduced by Sennrich, Haddow, and Birch in a paper entitled [Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909) in 2015 (although the official publication was in 2016). It was proposed as a solution to the open vocabulary problem in machine translation. The method is an adaptation of a data compression technique developed by [Philip Gage](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-new-algorithm-for-data-compression-Gage/1aa9c0045f1fe8c79cce03c7c14ef4b4643a21f8) back in 1994. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rare and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words are a known issue when dealing with language, so the proposal was to tokenize text in a way that allows for subword units. In this way, rare or OOV words could be composed of the subunits. Sennrich et al. showed that this approach gave better results than prior methods. "

    "Now, instead of *encodings* and *bytes* I want to come to grips with the terms *vocabulary*, *out-of-vocabulary*, and *tokenize*: what do they mean and why do I need them? \n",
    "\n",
    "I understand that large language models (LLMs) perform mathematical operations on their input to produce their output. So, it makes sense that they cannot process raw text. But, why not just use the numbers that come out of the UTF-8 encoding? The two main reasons against that approach that I can think of are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- encodings are about characters, not meaning; for example, 'dog' and 'canine' have similar meaning but very different encodings; likewise, 'act' and 'cat' would have similar encodings but have very different meanings; and\n",
    "- in order to process any text we would need about 1 million numbers, which would drastically increase the computation required (compared to current methods)"

    "\n",
    "To get to a better numeric representation of text, the usual starting point is *tokenization.* Tokenization is the process of breaking up text into smaller pieces called *tokens*, where a token is the smallest unit of text. Once it's decided what a token should be, the set of unique tokens represents the *vocabulary*. The idea then is that given any raw text, I can represent it as a sequence of tokens from the vocabulary. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process so far is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- define what is meant by a token\n",
    "- gather text that can be used as training data\n",
    "- break the training data into tokens\n",
    "- create a vocabulary from the unique set of tokens\n",
    "- break up any new text into tokens from this vocabulary\n",

    "I conclude that the \"no free lunch\" axiom is correct. Removing some problems seems to potentially introduce problems somewhere else. For instance, tokenizing at the character level means there would be no such thing as OOV or rare word problems, but the cost is that for any give text there is a large increase in the number of tokens. So, if token count represents, on some level, computation then we need more computation for the same text then, say, word level tokenization. If I keep the computation level fixed, then character level tokenization will significantly reduce the context window, that is, how much text can be processed at the same time by the LLM.\n"
